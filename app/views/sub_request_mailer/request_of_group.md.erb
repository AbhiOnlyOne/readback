Hey guys,

<%= @dj %> needs a sub <%= @sub_request.for %> from <%= @sub_request.episode.just_time_string html: false %>.  Here’s the thing: you, specifically, were singled out as worthy subs. ✨

> “<%= @sub_request.reason %>”  
--- <%= @dj %>

Don’t let <%= @dj %> down! 🙏  Please look at your schedule and [take this slot](<%= sub_request_url @sub_request %>).
