<p>Hello <%= @dj %>!</p>

<p>
WCBN is launching a new playlist database system—an extension to our
website—which digitizes the log book, integrates the sub board and training
database, and centralizes every DJ’s personal radio history on one
public-facing, customizable DJ Profile page.
</p>

<p>
It still works the same when you’re sitting in the FM studio, but you’ll need to
activate your account to request subs or fulfill requests, manage your rotating
slots on specialty shows, and customize your profile.
</p>

<p>
To activate your account, visit the following link, choose a password, and spend
a few minutes looking over the information on your profile.
</p>

<p><%= link_to 'Choose my password', edit_password_url(@dj, reset_password_token: @token) %></p>

<p>
If you have any questions about this new system, please contact <a
  href="mailto:dd@wcbn.org">Cameron</a>.
