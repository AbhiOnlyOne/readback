Hello, **DJ** <%= @dj %>

With that, you’re done with your training: you’re now a WCBN DJ!

You’ve probably already spoken to [the Programming Director](mailto:pd@wcbn.org) about when you’ll be able to get your own show, but as of today you can start subbing for nighttime slots.

This email is sent by WCBN’s Readback system, which you’ll use to record what songs you play, take and place sub requests, and tell your listeners a little about yourself!

To activate your account, visit the following link, choose a password, and spend a few minutes looking over the information on your profile.
