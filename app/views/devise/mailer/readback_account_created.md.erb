WCBN is launching a new playlist database system—an extension to our
website—which digitizes the log book, integrates the sub board and training
database, and centralizes every DJ’s personal radio history on one
public-facing, customizable DJ Profile page.

It still works the same when you’re sitting in the FM studio, but you’ll need to
activate your account to request subs or fulfill requests, manage your rotating
slots on specialty shows, and customize your profile.

To activate your account, visit the following link, choose a password, and spend
a few minutes looking over the information on your profile.

[Choose my password](<%=edit_password_url(@dj, reset_password_token: @token) %>)

If you have any questions about this new system, please contact [Cameron](mailto:dd@wcbn.org).

Hello, **DJ** <%= @dj %>

With that, you’re done with your training: you’re now a WCBN DJ!

You’ve probably already spoken to [the Programming Director](mailto:pd@wcbn.org) about when you’ll be able to get your own show, but as of today you can start subbing for nighttime slots.

This email is sent by WCBN’s Readback system, which you’ll use to record what songs you play, take and place sub requests, and tell your listeners a little about yourself!

To activate your account, visit the following link, choose a password, and spend a few minutes looking over the information on your profile.
